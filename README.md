//Cardify v-1.0.2
//Welcome one, Welcome all!
//Open-Source***

I've created this nifty little function system that allows one to add html elements together in concatenation purely in JavaScript without having to create multiple HTML object classes. If you have any critiques, feel free to send a pull request:

After creating your Card elements, append them to a Node in your document, like 
"body".
I've pre-created your body const: myBody

To nest elements within eachother, chain .append functions

In leiu of personal time constraits, Cardify does not yet support all HTML tags

Supported tags include:

 [div,h1-6,p,small,img,button,section,article]
